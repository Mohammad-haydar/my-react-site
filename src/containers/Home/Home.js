            Iâ€™m Melissa, a software developer from Manchester. Please take a
            look around!
          </h3>
          <p>
            I am excited to build software which has an effect on all those
            around me. The ideas we all have can be brought to real life.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a self-taught developer always looking to expand my knowledge.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            My skills range from the basic HTML, CSS(scss/sass) to JavaScript
            including React (redux, context API), Node, Express, MongoDB and
            many others. I have built multiple systems which include fully
            integrated backend servers with RESTful API's.
